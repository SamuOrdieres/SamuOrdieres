I started developing a geometrical area calculator in Visual Basic around the year 1999, and since then, I have been hooked.

For several reasons, I have developed my career at tech-based companies, but most of the roles were not so tech-related. After all those experiences, I have decided to pursue my passion and become a front-end developer.

After rolling and rolling around Europe, I am settled in Ceceda, a small village in the countryside of Asturias (Northern Spain). And IÂ´m trying to collaborate on the resettlement of rural areas. I think that technology and nature, far from being rivals, are the perfect balance, like the Yin and the Yang.
